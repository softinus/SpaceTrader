\brief  Repeatedly plays a Timeline effect defined in IVT data.

\sync

\remark The current implementation of #ImmVibePlayIVTEffectRepeat repeats only
        Timeline effects. If the given effect index refers to a simple effect,
        #ImmVibePlayIVTEffectRepeat ignores the \a nRepeat parameter and plays
        the simple effect once. In that case, #ImmVibePlayIVTEffectRepeat
        behaves like #ImmVibePlayIVTEffect. #ImmVibePlayIVTEffectRepeat does not
        return a warning when requested to repeat a simple effect.

\param[in]      hDeviceHandle
                            Device handle on which to play the effect. The
                            handle must have been obtained by calling

                            access built-in IVT effects.
\param[in]      nEffectIndex
                            Index of the effect. The index of the effect must be
                            greater than or equal to \c 0 and less than the
                            number of effects returned by
                            #ImmVibeGetIVTEffectCount.
\param[in]      nRepeat     Number of times to repeat the effect. To play the
                            effect indefinitely, set \a nRepeat to
                            #VIBE_REPEAT_COUNT_INFINITE. To repeat the effect a
                            finite number of times, set \a nRepeat to a value
                            from \c 0 to
                            <code>#VIBE_REPEAT_COUNT_INFINITE&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;1</code>.
                            The effect can be repeated at most
                            <code>#VIBE_REPEAT_COUNT_INFINITE&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;1</code>
                            times. Setting \a nRepeat to \c 0 plays the effect
                            once (repeats the effect zero times) and is
                            equivalent to calling #ImmVibePlayIVTEffect. To stop
                            the effect before it has repeated the requested
                            number of times, or to stop an effect that is
                            playing indefinitely, call

\param[in]      hDeviceHandle
                            Device handle on which to play the effect. The
                            handle must have been obtained by calling
                            #ImmVibeOpenDevice or #ImmVibeOpenCompositeDevice.
\param[in]      pData       Pointer to the PCM data defining the actuator drive
                            signal for the Waveform effect. The data is
                            formatted in the same way as the PCM data in a WAV
                            file with the exception that only 8-bit or 16-bit
                            mono (not stereo) samples are supported. This
                            parameter must not be \c NULL.
\param[in]      nDataSize   Size of the PCM data in bytes. The size must be
                            greater than zero. The maximum supported size is 16
                            megabytes, or less if limited by platform
                            constraints.
\param[in]      nSamplingRate
                            Sampling rate of PCM data in Hertz (number of
                            samples per second).
\param[in]      nBitDepth   Bit depth of PCM data, or number of bits per sample.
                            The only supported values are 8 or 16; that is, the
                            \player supports only 8-bit or 16-bit PCM data.
\param[in]      nMagnitude  Magnitude of the effect. The effect magnitude is
                            clamped to a value from #VIBE_MIN_MAGNITUDE to
                            #VIBE_MAX_MAGNITUDE, inclusive. When set to
                            #VIBE_MAX_MAGNITUDE, the PCM data samples are not
                            attenuated. For example: an 8-bit sample having a
                            value of 192 will output a drive signal that is
                            approximately 50% of maximum:
                            (192&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;128)&nbsp;/&nbsp;127&nbsp;=&nbsp;50%.
                            Magnitude values less than #VIBE_MAX_MAGNITUDE serve
                            to attenuate the PCM data samples.
\param[out]     phEffectHandle
                            Pointer to the variable that will receive a handle
                            to the playing effect.

\retval VIBE_S_SUCCESS      No error.
\retval VIBE_W_NOT_PLAYING  No more effect slots are available to play the
                            effect. Before playing the effect, you must call
                            #ImmVibeStopPlayingEffect or
                            #ImmVibeStopAllPlayingEffects to stop currently

                            on another higher priority device handle. Before
                            playing the effect, you must call
                            #ImmVibeStopPlayingEffect or
                            #ImmVibeStopAllPlayingEffects to stop currently
                            playing effects, or call

                            the #VIBE_DEVPROPTYPE_PRIORITY property.
\retval  VIBE_W_EFFECTS_DISABLED
                            Effects playing on the device handle have been
                            disabled. Call #ImmVibeSetDevicePropertyInt32 to set
                            the #VIBE_DEVPROPTYPE_DISABLE_EFFECTS property to
                            false to re-enable playing effects on the device
                            handle.
\retval VIBE_E_NOT_INITIALIZED
                           The \api has not been initialized. #ImmVibeInitialize
                           was not called or returned an error.
\retval VIBE_E_INVALID_ARGUMENT
                            One or more of the arguments are invalid. For
                            example:
                            -   The \a hDeviceHandle parameter specifies an
                                invalid device handle.
                            -   The value of one or more of the Waveform effect
                                parameters is invalid.
                            -   The \a phEffectHandle parameter is \c NULL.
\retval VIBE_E_FAIL         Error playing the effect.

                            and is formatted in the same way as the PCM data in
                            a WAV file with the exception that only 8-bit and
                            16-bit mono (not stereo) samples are supported. This
                            parameter must not be \c NULL.
\param[in]      nDataSize   Size of the PCM data to append in bytes. The size
                            must be greater than zero. The maximum supported

                            effect.
\param[in]      nBitDepth   Bit depth of PCM data, or number of bits per sample.
                            The only supported values are 8 or 16; that is, the
                            \player supports only 8-bit or 16-bit PCM data. This

                            Device handle on which to modify the playing effect.
                            The handle must have been obtained by calling
                            #ImmVibeOpenDevice or #ImmVibeOpenCompositeDevice,
                            and must be the same as the handle that was given
                            when the effect was played.
\param[in]      hEffectHandle
                            Handle to the Periodic effect to modify. The handle
                            must have been obtained by calling
                            #ImmVibePlayPeriodicEffect or #ImmVibePlayIVTEffect
                            to play the Periodic effect.
\param[in]      nDuration   Duration of the effect in milliseconds. To specify
                            an infinite duration, set this parameter to
                            #VIBE_TIME_INFINITE. For a finite duration, the
